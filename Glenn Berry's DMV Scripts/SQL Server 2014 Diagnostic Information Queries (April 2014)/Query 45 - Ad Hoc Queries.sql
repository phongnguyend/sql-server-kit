-- Gives you the text, type and size of single-use ad-hoc and prepared queries that waste space in the plan cache
-- Enabling 'optimize for ad hoc workloads' for the instance can help (SQL Server 2008 and above only)
-- Running DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE ('SQL Plans') periodically may be required to better control this.
-- Enabling forced parameterization for the database can help, but test first!
